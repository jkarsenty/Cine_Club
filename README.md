# Cine_Club

How to create a cine club with graphic interface.

I used python library PySide to make the User Interface.
There are 2 python files :
- movies.py contains  the python class with all the functions
- app.py contains the code for the user interface

The App allow us to add movie that we have seen and list them in the UI
The list of the movies is saved into a json file (no need to a database because for now it's only the titles of the movies)

The App looks like that :
